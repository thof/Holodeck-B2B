/**
 * Indicates a problem that occurred in the delivery of a message unit to the business application. This exception can
 * be thrown because a delivery method can not be successfully instantiated, i.e. the factory class can not be
 * initialized or during the actual delivery of a message.
 * <p>Since version HB2B_NEXT_VERSION the exception also has an indicator whether the encountered problem is
 * permanent or not, i.e. any new attempt of delivery is guaranteed to fail as well making retries meaningless. This
 * indicator is used when the delivery of a <i>User Message</i> message unit fails. When the delivery error is permanent
 * the delivery handler can generate an ebMS Error Signal to inform the <i>Sending</i> MSH.
